## Video Narration Script (Full English)

Meet Privacy Virtual Pet, a revolutionary FHEVM application demonstrating confidential computing on blockchain.

Imagine caring for a virtual pet where every stat—health, happiness, energy—remains completely encrypted. Your pet's data never exposes in plaintext, even during computations. Welcome to the future of privacy-preserving smart contracts.

The application is simple to use. Connect your MetaMask wallet to Sepolia network. Create your virtual companion with just one click. Then, care for your encrypted pet using intuitive action buttons. Feed it to boost happiness. Play to increase enjoyment but consume energy. Heal when health drops. Rest to recover. Watch real blockchain transactions confirm each action.

But this is more than just a game. Privacy Virtual Pet is a complete FHEVM Example Hub with production-grade automation tools. Our CLI scaffolds generate standalone example repositories in seconds. Need to understand access control patterns? Generate the example. Want to learn encrypted arithmetic? Use our automation tools. Generate documentation automatically from code. Run comprehensive test suites. Deploy to any supported network.

The infrastructure includes eighteen to thirty examples organized by learning level. From basic operations to advanced blind auction implementations. Each includes complete smart contracts, test suites, and auto-generated documentation using our GitBook-compatible generator.

Everything is open source, thoroughly documented with fifty thousand words, and production-ready. Experience privacy-preserving blockchain development with Privacy Virtual Pet. Where your pets are secure. Your data is encrypted. And learning FHEVM is simplified.
